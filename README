Singularity Systems: Zero to Hero (The Hacker's Guide to Tensor Compilers)

TODO:

------------------
Course Description
------------------
Singularity Systems: Zero to Hero follows up from Neural Networks: Zero to Hero.
We take micograd: backpropagation intuition and turn it into picograd, a deep
learning compiler.

Singularity Systems bridges the missing gap in the ecosystem for low level system
programmers and performance engineers interested in the internals of deep learning
frameworks. The course provides the software 2.0 equivalent of SICP (interpreters)
and dragon book (compilers), where you will build an PyTorch1-like-interpreter
and a PyTorch2-like-compiler that is *llama-complete*, line by line from scratch.
By the end of Singularity Systems, you will be better equipped to contribute
towards opensource projects such as PyTorch and Jax, both ~100kLOC. The appendix
also includes a traditional software 1.0 compiler mapping C to RISCV that is
*quake-complete*.



Prereqs
-------
- solid deep learning (gpt2 && llama2 && r1)
- solid systems programming (C || C++ || Rust || Python*)

  *: python is ok (following the footsteps of pure-python systems such as
     PyTorch 2.0 and CUTLASS 4.0), as long as you're coming in with basic
     computer architecture fundamentals.
