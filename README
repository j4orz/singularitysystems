Singularity Systems: Zero to Hero â€” The Hacker's Guide to Tensor Compilers (by j4orz)
* these course notes (formalizations of specifications) are complementary to
  the lecture videos (intuitive line by line implementations)

------------------
Course Description
------------------
Singularity Systems: Zero to Hero follows up from Neural Networks: Zero to Hero.
We turn micograd/autodidax, both toy backpropagation engines into picograd, a
full blown deep learning framework with support for tensor compilation and
distributed training.

Singularity Systems bridges the missing gap in the ecosystem for low level system
programmers and performance engineers interested in the internals of deep learning
frameworks. The course provides the software 2.0 equivalent of SICP (interpreters)
and dragon book (compilers), where you will build a PyTorch1-like interpreter
in chapters 1-2 and a PyTorch2-like compiler in chapters 3-4. Both will be
llama-complete and implemented line by line from scratch. By the end of
Singularity Systems, you will be better equipped to contribute towards opensource
projects such as PyTorch and Jax, both ~100kLOC. The appendix also includes a
traditional software 1.0 compiler mapping C to RISCV that is doom-complete.

Prereqs
-------
- solid deep learning (llama2 && r1)
- solid systems programming (C || C++ || Rust || Python*)
  * python is ok (following pure-python systems like PyTorch 2.0 & CUTLASS 4.0)
