# Singularity Systems: Zero to Hero
*SICP 2.0: The Hacker's Guide to Tensor Programs and Compilers*

**Singularity Systems: Zero to Hero** is a ["software 2.0"](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) textbook
that covers both the machine learning `program` and the `evaluator/translator`.
This format spans the entire semantic chasm from humans to electrons, pioneered
by the "software 1.0" textbooks [SICP 1996](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html), [HtDP 2001](https://htdp.org/) and [PAPL 2020](https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2020/). By the end of the textbook you should have the skills of a mediocre
**research scientist**, a mediocre **kernel authorer**, and a mediocre **compiler engineer**.
