# Singularity Systems: Zero to Hero
*SICTP 2.0: Structure and Interpretation/Compilation of Tensor Programs*

**Singularity Systems: Zero to Hero** is a 12 week accelerated course designed for
the age of ["software 2.0"](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35).
The textbook spans the entire semantic chasm from the transistor to the tensor,
covering both the machine learning `program` and the `evaluator/translator`.
After successfully completing the course you will have the solid foundation to
further specialize as a **research scientist**, a **kernel authorer**, or a **compiler engineer**.
