# Dedication

I dedicate this textbook to my father, [Thomas Zhang](https://ginsengpress.com/about-ginseng-press/).

In 2023, his wisdom guided me as my plans from graduate school were changed to leading
my sister's recovery program with her schizophrenia diagonosis. Not long after,
he showed an even deeper courage of his own, meeting an ischemic-hemorrhagic-transformed
stroke with unwavering strength and grace.
