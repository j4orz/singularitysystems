# Dedication

This textbook is dedicated to my father Thomas, brother Leo, and partner Anna
who have helped me when my plans for graduate school were changed to leading my
sister's recovery program with her schizophrenia diagnosis. I have learned more
about what life is truly about off the keyboard than I ever could have while
hacking on a terminal.
