# Dedication

This "textbook" is dedicated to my father Thomas, brother Leo, and partner Anna
who have helped me navigate the plan for graduate school being redirected
towards helping my sister and her diagnosis with schizophrenia. I have learned
more about what life is truly about off the keyboard than I ever could have
hacking on a terminal. Although I was not able to pursue my original goals
(at this time), I hope Singularity Systems can provide some use to the future
generation of programmers following the ways of old school hacker culture.
