# Chapter 3: pt2
**This chapter implements a compiler for neural networks (pytorch2).** This
compiler will translate a pytorch-like API to a triton-like tiling language. If
you prefer to learn "top-down", read chapter 2 followed by chapter 3. If you
prefer to learn "bottom-up", read chapter 3 followed by chapter 2.
